title: "Thank you"
---

Each of these thank you cards are made in R with ggplot2 by students in STA/ISS 313.
A huge thanks to all of our guest speakers!

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "Thank you cards created with ggplot2."}
thank_you_paths <- fs::dir_ls("images/thank-you-cards", regexp = "*md", invert = TRUE)
knitr::include_graphics(thank_you_paths)
```
