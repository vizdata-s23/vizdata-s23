# Warm up

## Announcements

-   Thank you for filling out the survey!

-   At this point everyone should be:

    -   On Slack, in public channels for #general, #homework, #project-1, #project-2, #quizzes, and #random as well as in a private channel for their lab section.
    -   Make sure your profile photo/avatar and name matches between GitHub and Slack.

-   HW 1 will be posted after class, due next Thursday.

    -   You'll get to work on it in lab next Wednesday, but you should start it before then and go to lab with questions.

## Setup {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(countdown)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggrepel)
library(waffle)
library(scales)

# set theme for ggplot2
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 14))

# set width of code output
options(width = 65)

# set figure parameters for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 7,        # 7" width
  fig.asp = 0.618,      # the golden ratio
  fig.retina = 3,       # dpi multiplier for displaying HTML output on retina
  fig.align = "center", # center align figures
  dpi = 300             # higher dpi, sharper image
)
```

## From last time

```{r}
#| label: data-prep

duke_forest <- duke_forest |>
  mutate(
    decade_built = (year_built %/% 10) * 10,
    decade_built_cat = case_when(
      decade_built <= 1940 ~ "1940 or before",
      decade_built >= 1990 ~ "1990 or after",
      TRUE ~ as.character(decade_built)
    )
  )

mean_area_decade <- duke_forest |>
  group_by(decade_built_cat) |>
  summarise(mean_area = mean(area))
```

# Geoms

## Geoms

-   Geometric objects, or **geoms** for short, perform the actual rendering of the layer, controlling the type of plot that you create

-   You can think of them as "the geometric shape used to represent the data"

## One variable

-   Discrete:

    -   `geom_bar()`: display distribution of discrete variable.

-   Continuous

    -   `geom_histogram()`: bin and count continuous variable, display with bars

    -   `geom_density()`: smoothed density estimate

    -   `geom_dotplot()`: stack individual points into a dot plot

    -   `geom_freqpoly()`: bin and count continuous variable, display with lines

## Aside

Always use "typewriter text" (monospace font) when writing function names, and follow with `()`, e.g.,

-   `geom_freqpoly()`

-   `mean()`

-   `lm()`

## `geom_dotplot()`

::: task
What does each point represent? How are their locations determined? What do the x and y axes represent?
:::

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 0.5

ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 50000)
```

## Comparing across groups {.smaller}

::: task
Which of the following allows for easier comparison across groups?
:::

::: panel-tabset
## Histogram

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 0.4

ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = price, fill = decade_built_cat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100000)
```

## Frequency polygon

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 0.4

ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = price, color = decade_built_cat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 100000, size = 1)
```
:::

## Two variables - both continuous

-   `geom_point()`: scatterplot

-   `geom_quantile()`: smoothed quantile regression

-   `geom_rug()`: marginal rug plots

-   `geom_smooth()`: smoothed line of best fit

-   `geom_text()`: text labels

## Application exercise - Part 1

::: task
-   Go to the course GitHub organization: <https://github.com/vizdata-s23>

-   Clone the repo called `ae-02-[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]` and work on the exercises for Part 1.

-   Once you're done, share your plots on Slack in #general.

-   Label your chunk(s) and pay attention to code style and formatting!
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 10, color_background = "white")
```

## Two variables - show density

-   `geom_bin2d()`: bin into rectangles and count

-   `geom_density2d()`: smoothed 2d density estimate

-   `geom_hex()`: bin into hexagons and count

## `geom_hex()`

Not very helpful for `r nrow(duke_forest)` observations:

```{r}
ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = area, y = price)) +
  geom_hex()
```

## `geom_hex()`

More helpful for `r nrow(diamonds)` observations:

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_hex()
```

## `geom_hex()` and warnings

-   Requires installing the [**hexbin**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hexbin/index.html) package separately!

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("hexbin")
```

-   Otherwise you might see

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    Warning: Computation failed in `stat_binhex()`

## Two variables

-   At least one discrete

    -   `geom_count()`: count number of point at distinct locations

    -   `geom_jitter()`: randomly jitter overlapping points

-   One continuous, one discrete

    -   `geom_col()`: a bar chart of pre-computed summaries

    -   `geom_boxplot()`: boxplots

    -   `geom_violin()`: show density of values in each group

## `geom_jitter()` {.smaller}

::: task
How are the following three plots different?
:::

::: panel-tabset

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 0.4

ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = bed, y = price)) +
