# Warm up

## Announcements

-   Peer eval 2 is due today at 5pm.

-   HW 06 is due Thursday at noon.

-   Course + TA evaluations are due on Thursday.

-   Don't

## Projects presentations

Show up at the beginning (or, better yet, 10 mins before) the time period you're assigned to:

Any questions / things I can clarify about the projects or anything else we have covered so far?

## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(scico)

# set theme for ggplot2
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 14))

# set width of code output
options(width = 65)

# set figure parameters for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 7, # 7" width
  fig.asp = 0.618, # the golden ratio
  fig.retina = 3, # dpi multiplier for displaying HTML output on retina
  fig.align = "center", # center align figures
  dpi = 300 # higher dpi, sharper image
)
```

## Generative art: what

> One overly simple but useful definition is that generative art is art programmed using a computer that intentionally introduces randomness as part of its creation process.
>
> [Jason Bailey](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/why-love-generative-art)

-   There is randomness to the art, introduced by the computer (the code)
-   The artist has control over the randomness, as contradictory as that may sound

## Generative art: why {.smaller}

-   Why people create generative art pieces?
    -   Artistic expression
    -   Leveraging computers to generate randomness
    -   ...

. . .

-   Why are we learning about generative art?
    -   A different look at data visualization: not for the meaning in the data, but for the visual itself
    -   Great way to practice programming, particularly if you're into creating art
    -   Opportunity to practice problem solving skills, particularly if you're sketching first, then creating or reproducing an existing piece

## Generative art in use: Book covers

Just one of many examples of generative art as a practical solution by the New York Public Library:

To fill in missing book covers in an ebook-borrowing and reading app

# I can plot myself flowers

## Let's make a circle

```{r}
#| label: circle-points
#| output-location: column

# make a circle of points
t <- seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 50)
x <- sin(t)
y <- cos(t)
df <- tibble(t, x, y)

# plot a circle of points
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal()
```

## The Golden Angle

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" fragment-index="1"}
The golden angle is the angle subtended by the smaller (red) arc when two arcs that make up a circle are in the golden ratio.

$$ \pi(3 − \sqrt{5}) $$

![](images/Golden_Angle.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" fragment-index="2"}
The golden angle is the angle separating successive florets on a sunflower.

## Petals with the golden angle {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: golden-paths
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "|1-2|4-5|7-13|15-19"

# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 50

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_path(color = "gray") +
  geom_text(aes(label = i)) +
  coord_equal()
```

## Paths to points {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: golden-points
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "|17"

# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 50

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal()
```

## Without the background

```{r}
#| label: golden-points-void
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "|19"

# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 50

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```

## More points {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: golden-points-more-void
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "|5"

# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 100

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```

## Adjust points {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: golden-points-more-void-adjust
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "|10"

# set golden angle
angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

# set number of points
points <- 100

# make data frame
df <- tibble(
  i = 1:points,
  t = (1:points) * angle + 20,
  x = sin(t),
  y = cos(t)
)

# plot points in a spiral
ggplot(df, aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```

# Formalize a system

## Write a function: `build_art()`

```{r}
build_art <- function() {

  # set golden angle
  angle <- pi * (3 - sqrt(5))

  # set number of points
  points <- 100

  # make data frame
  tibble(
    i = 1:points,
    t = (1:points) * angle + 20,
    x = sin(t),
    y = cos(t)
  )
}
```

## Add arguments to `build_art()` {.smaller}

```{r}
build_art <- function(points, angle, adjustment) {
  tibble(
    i = 1:points,
    t = (1:points) * angle + adjustment,
    x = sin(t),
    y = cos(t)
  )
}
```

. . .

```{r}
build_art(
  angle = pi * (3 - sqrt(5)),
  points = 100,
  adjustment = 20
)
```

## Use the function {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: points-100
#| output-location: column

build_art(
  angle = pi * (3 - sqrt(5)),
  points = 100,
  adjustment = 20
) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```

## Change parameters {.smaller}

```{r}
#| label: points-500
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "|2-4"

build_art(
  angle = 3,
  points = 500,
  adjustment = 0
) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x * t, y = y * t)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_void()
```

## Next steps...

-   Add random noise
-   Add more customization options
    -   Size
    -   Color
    -   Shape
    -   ...

## Livecoding
