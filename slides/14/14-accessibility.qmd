# Accessibility and screen readers

## Alternative text

> It is read by screen readers in place of images allowing the content and function of the image to be accessible to those with visual or certain cognitive disabilities.
>
> It is displayed in place of the image in browsers if the image file is not loaded or when the user has chosen not to view images.
>
> It provides a semantic meaning and description to images which can be read by search engines or be used to later determine the content of the image from page context alone.

## Alt and surrounding text {.smaller}

```         
"CHART TYPE of TYPE OF DATA where REASON FOR INCLUDING CHART`

+ Link to data source somewhere in the text
```

. . .

-   `CHART TYPE`: It's helpful for people with partial sight to know what chart type it is and gives context for understanding the rest of the visual.

. . .

-   `TYPE OF DATA`: What data is included in the chart? The x and y axis labels may help you figure this out.

. . .

-   `REASON FOR INCLUDING CHART`: Think about why you're including this visual. What does it show that's meaningful. There should be a point to every visual and you should tell people what to look for.

. . .

-   `Link to data source`: Don't include this in your alt text, but it should be included somewhere in the surrounding text.

## Developing the alt text {.smaller}

-   Total employed registered nurses in three states over time.

. . .

-   Total employed registered nurses in California, New York, and North Carolina, in 2000, 2010, and 2020.

. . .

-   A bar chart of total employed registered nurses in California, New York, and North Carolina, in 2000, 2010, and 2020, showing increasing numbers of nurses over time.

. . .

-   The figure is a bar chart titled "Total employed Registered Nurses" that displays the numbers of registered nurses in three states (California, New York, and North Carolina) over a 20 year period, with data recorded in three time points (2000, 2010, and 2020). In each state, the numbers of registered nurses increase over time. The following numbers are all approximate. California started off with 200K registered nurses in 2000, 240K in 2010, and 300K in 2020. New York had 150K in 2000, 160K in 2010, and 170K in 2020. Finally North Carolina had 60K in 2000, 90K in 2010, and 100K in 2020.

The figure is titled "Annual median salary of Registered Nurses". There are three lines on the plot: the top labelled California, the middle New York, the bottom North Carolina. The vertical axis is labelled "Annual median salary", beginning with $40K, up to $120K. The horizontal axis is labelled "Year", beginning with couple years before 2000 up to 2020. The following numbers are all approximate. In the graph, the California line begins around $50K in 1998 and goes up to  $120K in 2020. The increase is steady, except for stalling for about couple years between 2015 to 2017. The New York line also starts around $50K, just below where the California line starts, and steadily goes up to $90K. And the North Carolina line starts around $40K and steadily goes up to $70K.

Scatter plots are among the more difficult graphs to describe, especially if there is a need to make specific data point accessible.

-   Identify the image as a scatter plot
-   Provide the title and axis labels
-   Focus on the overall trend
-   If it's necessary to be more specific, convert the data into an accessible table

[Accessible Visualization via Natural Language Descriptions: A Four-Level Model of Semantic Content](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/pubs/vis-text-model/)

Alan Lundgard, MIT CSAIL\
Arvind Satyanarayan, MIT CSAIL

IEEE Transactions on Visualization & Computer Graphics (Proceedings of IEEE VIS), 2021

> To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences.

## Testing for colorblind friendliness

-   Best way to test is with users (or collaborators) who have these color deficiencies

-   Simulation software also helps, e.g. Sim Daltonism for [Mac](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/) and [PC](https://pcmacstore.com/en/app/693112260/sim-daltonism)

## Color contrast I

-   Background and foreground text should have sufficient contrast to be distinguishable by users with different vision

-   Web app for checking color contrast checking: [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)

## Color contrast II

A WIP R package for checking for color contrast: [**coloratio**](https://matt-dray.github.io/coloratio)

```{r}
cr_get_ratio("black", "white")
cr_get_ratio("#FFFFFF", "#000000")
cr_get_ratio("black", "gray10")
```

## Double encoding

Use shape *and* color where possible

# Accessibility and fonts

## Accessibility and fonts

-   Use a font that has been tested for accessibility (e.g., [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible))

. . .

-   Keep plot labels and annotations similarly sized as the rest of your text (e.g., `ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 16))`)
