## Themes: what, why, and how {.smaller}

-   **What:** the plot
    -   Specific types of visualizations for a particular purpose (e.g., maps for spatial data, Sankey diagrams for proportions, etc.)
    -   Tooling to produce them (e.g., specific R packages)

. . .

-   **How:** the process
    -   Start with a design (sketch + pseudo code)
    -   Pre-process data (e.g., wrangle, reshape, join, etc.)
    -   Map data to aesthetics
    -   Make visual encoding decisions t(e.g., address accessibility concerns)
    -   Post-process for visual appeal and annotation

. . .

-   **Why:** the theory
    -   Tie together "how" and "what" through the grammar of graphics

# But first...

## Show and tell {.smaller}

::: task
-   Form a small group (2-4 people) with people sitting around you

-   First, introduce yourselves to each other -- name (and proper pronunciation of name), year, major, where are you from, etc.

-   Start with the bad graphs -- Share your examples of "bad" graphs and why you think they're bad.

-   Then, share your good graphs -- Same deal, share your examples of "good" graphs and why you think they're good.

-   Finally, choose the **one** plot from your group that you think is most striking, either because it's bad or because it's good, and have one team member share the graph on #general in Slack.

## Lectures {.smaller}

-   In person

-   Attendance is required (as long as you're healthy!)

-   A little bit of everything:

    -   Traditional lecture
    -   Live coding + demos
    -   Short exercises + solution discussion

-   Recordings will be posted after class -- to be used for review + make-up if you can't make it to class due to health reasons, they're not an alternative to class attendance

## Labs

-   Attendance is required (as long as you're healthy!)

-   Opportunity to work on course assignments with TA support

-   Opportunity to work with teammates on projects

## Announcements

-   Posted on Sakai (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly

-   I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day

## Diversity and inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

-   If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know!

-   Please let me know your preferred pronouns.

-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.

-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

## GitHub {.smaller}

::: {.large style="text-align: center;"}
<https://github.com/vizdata-s23>
:::

-   GitHub organization for the course

-   All of your work and your membership (enrollment) in the organization is private

-   Each assignment is a private repo on GitHub, I distribute the assignments on GitHub and you submit them there

-   Feedback on assignments is given as GitHub issues, scores recorded on Sakai Gradebook

::: task
Fill out the *Getting to know you* survey for collection of your account names, later this week you will be invited to the course organization.
:::

## Username advice {.smaller}

::: hand
in case you don't yet have a GitHub account...
:::

Some brief advice about selecting your account names (particularly for GitHub),

-   Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with and makes your username easier for people to guess or remember

-   Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack

-   Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss

-   Shorter is better than longer, but be as unique as possible

-   Make it timeless. Avoid highlighting your current university, employer, or place of residence

## Slack {.smaller}

-   Online forum for asking and answering questions

-   Private repo in the course organization

-   You will need to join the course organization for access

-   Ask **and answer** questions related to course logistics, assignment, etc. here

-   Personal questions (e.g., extensions, illnesses, etc.) should be via email to me

-   Once you join, browse the channels to make sure you're posting questions in the right channel, update your profile with your name, photo/avatar of you that matches your GitHub profile, and your pronouns

-   **Unfortunately** Slack is **not** the best place to ask coding questions, but it's a great place for real-time connection and collaboration

::: task
Demo on Tuesday for asking good questions with proper code formatting.

# Grammar of graphics

## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's mind than any other device." \-\-- John Tukey*

-   Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data

-   Many tools for visualizing data \-- R is one of them

-   Many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations \-- **ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use

## ggplot2 ∈ tidyverse

## Hello ggplot2!

-   `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2
-   Plots are constructed in layers
-   Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

-   The ggplot2 package comes with the tidyverse

```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
```

-   For help with ggplot2, see [ggplot2.tidyverse.org](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

## Data: Palmer Penguins

Measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.

## An improved goal {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r}
#| ref.label: "improved-goal-plot"

## Code

```{r}
#| label: improved-goal-plot

ggplot(
  penguins,
  aes(x = bill_depth_mm,y = bill_length_mm,colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Bill depth and length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Bill depth (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    colour = "Species",
    caption = "Source: Palmer Station LTER / palmerpenguins package"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind()
```

## Narrative

Start with the `penguins` data frame, map bill depth to the x-axis and map bill length to the y-axis.

Represent each observation with a point and map species to the colour of each point.

Title the plot "Bill depth and length", add the subtitle "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins", label the x and y axes as "Bill depth (mm)" and "Bill length (mm)", respectively, label the legend "Species", and add a caption for the data source.

Finally, use a discrete colour scale that is designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness.
