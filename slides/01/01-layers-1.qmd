# Warm up

## Announcements

-   Office hours + locations finalized at [vizdata.org/course-team.html](https://vizdata.org/course-team.html).

-   Don't forget to complete the getting to know you survey by 8pm today at the latest!

-   A note on readings for this week: Some of it is review so feel free to skim those parts.

## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
#| code-line-numbers: "|1-4|6-7|9-10|12-19"

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(countdown)

# set theme for ggplot2
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 14))

# set width of code output
options(width = 65)

# set figure parameters for knitr
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 7,        # 7" width
  fig.asp = 0.618,      # the golden ratio
  fig.retina = 3,       # dpi multiplier for displaying HTML output on retina
  fig.align = "center", # center align figures
  dpi = 300             # higher dpi, sharper image

## Data-to-ink ratio {.smaller}

Tufte strongly recommends maximizing the **data-to-ink ratio** this in the Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Tufte, 1983).

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
> Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data---a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design ... \[It\] consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. ... \[It\] is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space ... \[It\] is nearly always multivariate ... And graphical excellence requires telling the truth about the data. (Tufte, 1983, p. 51).

## Application exercise {.smaller}

::: task
-   Go to the course GitHub organization: <https://github.com/vizdata-s23>

-   Clone the repo called `ae-01` and work on the exercise.

    -   Note: For today, this is not a personalized repo for you. The repo is public so everyone can clone it, but you won't be able to push to it. Starting Thursday you'll start getting your personalized repos you can push to.

-   Once you're done, share your code on Slack in #general.

-   Label your chunk(s) and pay attention to code style and formatting!

## Discussion

Can you spot the differences between the code here and the one provided in the previous slide? Are there any differences in the resulting plot? Work in a pair (or group) to answer.

```{r echo = FALSE}

```

## Global vs. layer-specific aesthetics

-   Aesthetic mappings can be supplied in the initial `ggplot()` call, in individual layers, or in some combination of both.

-   Within each layer, you can add, override, or remove mappings.

-   If you only have one layer in the plot, the way you specify aesthetics doesn't make any difference. However, the distinction is important when you start adding additional layers.

## Activity: Spot the differences I\| {.smaller}

::: task
Do you expect the following plots to be the same or different? If different, how? Discuss in a pair (or group) without running the code and sketch the resulting plots based on what you think the code will produce.

# Plot B
